stack overflow seems to happen when trying to select enemy pieces from all pieces

it is getting into the if statement

It's stack overflowing trying to check possible moves for team2 king
king's basic moves are overflowing?

not getting past King#enemy_moves
not getting past each in King#enemy_moves

It's stack overflowing when both kings have possible moves
